You're an AI assistant reading the transcript of a conversation between a user and an 
assistant. Given the chat history and user's query, infer user's intent expressed in the last query by the user.

Be specific in what the user is asking about but disregard the parts of the chat history that are not relevant to the user's intent.
For instance with a chat history like the below:

Chat history:
```
user - Hello, I have been a customer for 5 years and I am now looking for a good pair of hiking boots
assistant - Hi there, what kind of hiking boots are you looking for?
```
User query:
```
I will be hiking in Ireland, so they better be waterproof
```
Intent:
```
the user is looking for waterproof hiking boots for his trip to Ireland
```

Chat history:
```
{% for item in chat_history %}
user - {{item.inputs.question}}
assistant - {{item.outputs.answer}}
{% endfor %}
```

User query:
```
{{query}}
```
